# Spring Training Repository

## Description
Welcome to my training repository, where I explore the Spring Framework and showcase its practical applications. This repository serves as my dedicated training ground, allowing me to gain hands-on experience and proficiency in various aspects of Spring, including Spring MVC, dependency injection, RESTful API development, database integration, security implementation, testing, and debugging.

## Objective
My objective is to develop a strong foundation in Spring by actively engaging in hands-on exercises and projects. 
Through this training, I aim to acquire proficiency in Spring MVC, dependency injection, RESTful API development, database integration, security implementation, testing, and debugging. 
The knowledge and skills I gain will be applied to the completion of the Chemlabtracker project â€” 
an electronic laboratory notebook that utilizes Java to record and analyze experimental data in the field of organic chemistry.

Feel free to explore the code and documentation in this repository as I progress in my learning journey with Spring.
